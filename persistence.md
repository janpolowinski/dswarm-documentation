[This module](https://github.com/dswarm/dswarm/tree/builds/unstable/persistence) is responsible for the [[metadata repository|Glossary#metadata-repository]] (currently a relational database; MySQL) and the [[data hub|Glossary#data-hub]] (currently a graph database; [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/)). The [[Graph Data Model]] (GDM) format acts as exchange format between the back end and the [[d:swarm Neo4j unmanaged extension|Neo4j extension]]. The code of the GDM (Java) object structure and (JSON) de-/serialization is currently hosted in the [dswarm-gdm-java](https://github.com/dswarm/dswarm-gdm-java) repository.
