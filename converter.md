[This module](https://github.com/dswarm/dswarm/tree/builds/unstable/converter) makes use of [Metafacture](https://github.com/culturegraph/metafacture-core/wiki) to transform data. For this purpose, a [[Task|Glossary#task]] object is created to assemble a processing pipeline. The [[Job|Glossary#job]] that is modelled by a system librarian in the front end is send to the back end. The back end then converts its including [[mappings|Glossary#mapping]] to a [Metamorph](https://github.com/culturegraph/metafacture-core/wiki/Metamorph-User-Guide) script, processes the transformation pipeline and returns the result to the [[front end]] and/or saves the result in [[data hub|Glossary#data-hub]].
