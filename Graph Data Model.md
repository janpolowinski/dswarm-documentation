A [[graph data model|Glossary#graph-data-model]] implies the notion of [[nodes|Glossary#node]] and [[edges|Glossary#relationship. In the graph data model, [[statements|Glossary#statement]] are represented as directed binary graphs â€“ they always consist of a subject __node__, a predicate __edge__ and an object __node__.

## Nodes

Nodes can be

1. a resource or the entry point of a resource,
2. part of a resource ([[BNode|Glossary#blank-node]]), i.e. a subelement of a hierarchical description of a resources, e.g. a field in a MARCXML recordset ([[record|Glossary#record]]), or
3. simple value nodes, i.e. [[literals|Glossary#literal]].
