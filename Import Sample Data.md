In order to define mappings and transformation routines sample data need to be imported to d:swarm.

__Note:__ Imports are achieved via file uploads in the alpha release. In future versions you will be able to load sample data via interfaces like OAI-PMH etc.

## Import Workflow

Use the import function to import sample data:

* Click the tab “Import” (1).
* Click on “Search” or “Choose File” (depending on the browser you use) (2). A dialog box will open.
* Find the file you want to upload (you can upload only one file at a time).
  * __Note:__ You can import files of any format. At this stage, however, only CSV, XML and MABXML configuration options are available. File formats will not be validated.
* Click on “Open” to confirm your choice.
* Choose a telling name for the data resource contained in your file (obligatory) and write a short description (optional) (3).
* Finish the upload process by clicking on “Submit” (4).

Having successfully imported the data resource you will be automatically delegated to the tab “Data” in the list “Available for configuration”.
